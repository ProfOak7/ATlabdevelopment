BIO205 Human Anatomy Spring 2025 Laboratory Objectives
Introduction
Welcome to the Human Anatomy Lab. Learning about the human body is a rigorous, but achievable goal if you budget your time wisely. The Laboratory Objectives, combined with the audio files, will guide your study for
success in each of the 10 lab exams, and describe how each lab exam score will be
tabulated. If you achieve these objectives, you should do very well on lab exams.
The lecture portion of this course has separate objectives, which share much
overlap with the lab objectives. Your laboratory study will strengthen and expand your grasp of the lecture material and help you succeed on the lecture exams.
The lab is delivered in an audio-tutorial (AT) manner. You will attend lab every week to study on your own, and to interact with classmates, tutors, and instructors. You will listen to audio instructions, work on computer assignments, and study the
models, charts, and files. We have AT labs at the San Luis Obispo (room 2201) and the North County (room N2438) Campuses with many open hours each week; both
schedules are on Canvas and posted in each laboratory location. You should attend lab as much as you are able. There are minimum study requirements you must clock on your time sheet before each lab exam. Your lab time will be printed on
time sheets using a standard time punch-clock. The completed time sheet is
presented to the instructor at the beginning of your oral exam.
As you faithfully prepare yourself and complete each lab exam, this unique audiotutorial
lab study will develop your strong, independent habit of study as you benefit from a growing network of supportive classmates, helpful tutors, and
knowledgeable instructors.
During a typical lab visit, you will first identify a place to study, clock in, then open
the files for that lesson (available on Canvas). The audio may direct you to
particular models, specimen, parts of your text, or computer exercises. As you study, guided by the laboratory objectives, you will learn the material you need for success on lab exams. On or before the deadline your instructor provides in the
course schedule, you will take the lab exams. The lab exams primarily consist of
two parts: 1) an oral exam given in person by the instructor on duty, and 2) a Canvas Quiz administered online. Most students will succeed because the
objectives are a list of exactly what you need to know. If you learn the material, you will do well. Make sure you sign up in advance - and only once - for each of your oral lab exams. Make sure you show up for your oral exam time!
Success in this course will demand your motivation and dedication. Human Anatomy requires memorization and there are no short-cuts. Much of your time
and focus will be required if you are to succeed. Many other students, before you
have done it.
So… are you ready for some anatomy?! Let’s go!

Bio 205 Human Anatomy Student Learning Outcomes
Summarize the scientific method and evaluate its role in
research.
Identify important structures of cells, tissues, organs and organ systems of the human body.
Audio Tutorial Lab Policies and Guidelines
STUDENT PREPARATION:
• You should familiarize yourself with the laboratory activity to be performed. Listen to instructions on the audio and read any notes on the white board.
• Do not attempt to start work until you have listened to instructions on the
audio.
• Get help from instructors, tutors, and other students, but you are responsible
for your own work. Copying the work of others is considered cheating and will result in a grade of zero on the assignment and may result in a grade of
“F” in the course.
TIME CLOCK:
• Time sheets are located at the beginning of each unit.
• Clock in when you arrive in lab and clock out when you leave. Clocking in and leaving lab without permission will result in the failure of Anatomy. (i.e., You will be dismissed with an "F" grade.)
• You will be required to spend a minimum number of hours studying in the
lab. The minimum time for each of the ten labs is noted at the top of each time-clock sheet. You should spend much more time in lab than the
minimum required time to be successful in Human Anatomy, however. You are receiving credit for 6 hours of lab study each week. Plan ahead.
• Scan your time sheet then submit it on Canvas after you completed the
required hours and the oral lab exam score is visible.
COMPUTERS AND MATERIALS:
• The audio and other lab files are available on Canvas and can be used anywhere. Audio transcripts are also provided.
• All physical materials such as models and books are for use in the AT Lab only. Removal of materials from the AT Lab constitutes theft of college
property and will result in dismissal with a grade of "F."
• Computers are for college related projects only! STUDENT SAFETY:
• Pencils, labels, or other materials should never be placed in your mouth.
• All trash and debris must be placed in wastebaskets and not left on the
demonstration table or in sinks. If you chew gum, please dispose of it properly. (i.e. Wrap it in paper and place in the trash cans available.)
• Your area should be cleaned up before you finish and leave the laboratory.
STUDENT USE OF EQUIPMENT:
Microscope
• You must carry one microscope with two hands.
• The eyepiece and objective lenses should be cleaned with special lens paper and only when necessary.
• All “wet mounts” should have cover slips.
• Always return the microscope clean, with the 4X objective (shortest lens) in position, cord wrapped around the base, covered with a plastic bag and
placed in the proper location at the demonstration table.
Bones and Models
• Wash your hands before handling bones or models, and after blowing your nose or sneezing. Unwashed hands dirty the models, damages the paint on models, and can spread infections.
• All specimens and models should be treated as though you are financially responsible for them.
• Wooden pointer sticks are provided. Use these, not pens or pencils, to
identify items on the models. Pens and pencils leave marks, which are
difficult to remove.
STUDENT HONOR CODE:
You should follow a code of ethics, which stresses personal responsibility and integrity. Your participation in the Anatomy Lab will not be constantly monitored, but one would hope that students exhibit behavior suited for success. Where
mutual respect and trust rule, there is no need for restrictions on student activities.

• Thoracic vertebrae have costal (rib) facets and demi facets, and do not have transverse foramen.
• Lumbar vertebrae lack both transverse foramen and rib facets.
• Intervertebral foramina are formed when two vertebrae articulate (are joined).
