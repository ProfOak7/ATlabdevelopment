Human Anatomy
Fall Semester 2025 - 70865
Course Syllabus


Welcome to Human Anatomy!
Hi everyone, and welcome to Human Anatomy at Cuesta College! I’m really glad you’re here. This course is an exciting and in-depth journey through the human body—challenging, yes, but also incredibly rewarding for those who are ready to fully engage. If you’re someone who enjoys learning how the body works, and you’re prepared to put in the time and effort, you're in the right place.
That said, this is not an entry-level science course. Human Anatomy (BIO 205) is designed for students who have already completed at least one college-level biology course. If you’ve never taken a college science class before, I strongly recommend starting with Human Biology (BIO 212) or equivalent. These courses provide an excellent foundation and will better prepare you for success in Anatomy.
Over the next eighteen weeks, we’ll explore the human body through lectures, lab activities, study guides, and hands-on learning with anatomical models. It’s a rigorous course—no sugarcoating that—but if you can stay organized, build a study routine, and stay curious, you’ll learn more than you might think possible!
Here are a few important things to know:
* This class meets in person and you are required to be present during all scheduled class times. Some lab exams will be conducted online via Canvas, and we may occasionally meet on Zoom– but most work happens face-to-face or on the computers provided in the Audio-Tutorial Lab (AT Lab).
* Reliable internet and a computer or tablet (not a phone) are necessary for completing online lab components. Cuesta College offers Free Wi-Fi for registered students, and Chromebooks are available for loan if needed.
* Most of your grade comes from exams—both lecture and lab. Lab exams usually include an open-note online quiz and a closed-note oral exam conducted in the AT Lab by appointment.
Success in this course depends on consistent effort. Don’t wait to get started! Set a schedule, attend every class, ask questions, and use the many resources available to you. Students who fall behind often struggle to catch up, so stay on top of things from the start! 
Please print your syllabus and schedule, and check Canvas announcements and your email daily for important updates and reminders about assignments.
So… are you ready for ANATOMY? Let’s dive in!

      * Important dates to keep in mind throughout the summer term:
      * Last date to drop the course with a refund – August 24th, 2025
      * Last day to drop the course with a “W” – November 2nd, 2025


      * Lecture Sessions:  Wednesdays 3:00 – 4:50 PM, SLO Campus, Room 2401
      * This course follows a "hybrid" format, meaning it combines both online and in-person components. The class meets in person for lectures and labs, while exams are administered both in person and online. Cuesta College uses an online learning system called Canvas and may also conduct meetings via Zoom. For this course, you must be available during the scheduled class time to attend lectures and take your lecture exams. Weekly attendance at lectures and labs is mandatory, with further details provided in the syllabus.
      * You must also have access to a computer with strong Wi-Fi and the Google Chrome browser to complete the online portion of your lab exams. (Cuesta College offers free Wi-Fi for registered students, and Chromebooks are available for free rental through the library.)

         * AT Lab Sessions (mine):          Tuesdays 6:00 – 9:00 PM, North County Campus, Room N2438
Wednesdays 9:30 AM - 1:00 PM, SLO Campus, Room 2201
         * You can attend Audio-Tutorial Labs (AT Labs) with any instructor—it doesn’t have to be me. Lab exams are divided into two parts: a written component (completed online as open-note Canvas quizzes) and an oral exam (completed without notes) in the AT Lab by appointment with the instructor on duty. You can complete the oral exam during any open lab hours at either the SLO or NCC campus.
         * To take each lab exam (both the written and oral components), you must meet a minimum number of lab attendance hours beforehand. For example, you need to complete two hours of lab time before taking Lab Exam #1. You have the flexibility to choose the times and locations that work best for you—both the SLO (Room 2201) and NCC (Room 2438) campuses have AT Labs. Lab schedules, including open hours, are posted in the Canvas modules. Failure to meet the required hours will result in a deduction of 5 points per hour missed. The AT Lab hours of operation for both campuses are listed in your Canvas course modules.
         * Instructors are available during all open lab hours. You are required to visit the lab weekly and complete the oral portion of your lab exams there by making an appointment with the instructor on duty. To earn full credit for lab participation, you must fulfill the required lab attendance hours; otherwise, you will lose points. The hourly lab time requirements for each of the ten labs are detailed in the “Lab Objectives” booklet, which will be explained further during your first meeting.
         * When visiting the lab, be sure to use the time clock located in the lab and record your attendance in the time sheet found in your “Lab Objectives” booklet to track your hours accurately.
         * Course Description
         * Human Anatomy course introduces the structure and function of the human body. It introduces and integrates cytology, histology, embryology and pathology throughout each organ system. It includes gross and microscopic anatomy of the integumentary, skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, sensory, circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, urinary and reproductive organ systems. Labs include study of preserved specimens, models, charts and online files.
