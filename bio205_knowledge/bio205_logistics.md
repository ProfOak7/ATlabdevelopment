Lab Objectives — Quick Pointers

Use the Lab Objectives booklet (Spring 2025 version) for exactly what to study for each lab exam; it also lists required minimum hours before each exam and the oral vs. Canvas quiz breakdown.

Examples from the booklet:

Lab Exam 5 focuses on Nervous System (models, cranial nerves, CSF flow, reflex arc).

Lab Exam 6 includes Endocrine & Senses with Canvas and oral components.

Lab Exam 9 emphasizes Digestive (trace food, bile; oral checklist).

Tutor behavior: when a question matches “when is Exam X?” or “what time is the final?”, answer directly from this file; otherwise use retrieval for deeper content and cite [Source: bio205_logistics.md].
